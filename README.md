# SSD-Killer
_Writes huge amount of data in relative "long time" depending on write speed of disk; this operation repeated many times_  
**terminates the life cycle of an SSD.**

# Timings
With 3500MB/s of write speed, the disk will be considerably wearout-ed in ~7.9 hours.  
We'll assume that 100TB is the wearout level that we want to reach.  
-> 100 TB / 0.0035 TB/s = 7.9h
